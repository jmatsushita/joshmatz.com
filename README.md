## Technology Colophon

As someone who lives in front-end code, having a back-end CMS that over complicated a number of problems didn't seem completely necessary for my personal site. So obviously when I heard about flat builds coming into their own I jumped at the change to use the technology. The flat build means my site is pre-compiled in its entirety into static files that are then deployed to my server. To get it just right there's quite a few intermixing of the different technologies involved. But, I'm always looking to improve my process so if you raise an eyebrow to something, feel free to [drop me a line](http://www.twitter.com/joshmatz).

### Tools
- **Prose:** [Prose](http://prose.io) lets you edit content straight from your Github repo quickly and easily in the browser. It has an excellent markdown editor to boot!
- Sublime Text 2
- Github for Mac

### Major Languages
- Ruby
- JavaScript
- Sass/SCSS

### Frameworks
- **Jekyll:** Jekyll compiles everything for me into structured folders with static HTML and JSON files.
- **Grunt:** Grunt is useful for a variety of tasks (and in fact could likely take Jekyll's place), but I use it to compile and minify JS and SCSS files (and run unit tests if I were to ever get around to it...).
- **Bower:** Bower manages the front-end packages I may need (jQuery, AngularJS, etc.).
- **Bundler:** Bundler keeps track of any Ruby dependencies the project needs.
- **Compass:** Compass comes with a number of tools that makes writing CSS super convenient.
