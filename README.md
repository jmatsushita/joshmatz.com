## Technology Colophon

A number of community tools went into this project. So it's only fair that I give back and let you know what exactly is used and for what. This is that list.

### Tools
- **Prose:** [Prose](http://prose.io) lets you edit content straight from your Github repo quickly and easily in the browser. It has an excellent markdown editor to boot!
- **Sublime Text 2:** Fairly obvious. :)
- **Github for Mac:** Source control. I prefer the interface to any other git app I've tried.

### Major Languages
- **Ruby:** Jekyll, Sass and Compass require Ruby to be installed. However, I don't have to actually write much of any Ruby.
- **JavaScript:** Grunt runs off this. As well as all the cool stuff for the web site.
- **Sass/SCSS:** This just makes writing CSS so much more enjoyable.

### Frameworks
- **Jekyll:** Jekyll compiles everything for me into structured folders with static HTML and JSON files.
- **Node.JS:** Node is used by grunt. It's highly awesome and I highly recommend checking it out.
- **Grunt:** Grunt is useful for a variety of tasks (and in fact could likely take Jekyll's place), but I use it to compile and minify JS and SCSS files (and run unit tests if I were to ever get around to it...).
- **Bower:** Bower manages the front-end packages I may need (jQuery, AngularJS, etc.).
- **Bundler:** Bundler keeps track of any Ruby dependencies the project needs.
- **Compass:** Compass comes with a number of tools that makes writing CSS super convenient.
